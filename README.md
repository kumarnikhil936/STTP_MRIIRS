Presentation and Notebook for the Tech-Talk at STTP MRIIRS

The files here belong to the talk I gave in the AICTE sponsored Short Term Training Program (STTP) at Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies on December 17th ,2020.

The iPython Notebook is taken from Kaggle and is a good example of how Autoencoders work with a usecase like Credit Card Fraud Detection.
